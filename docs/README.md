# Docs

## Overview
Theory + architecture sources for BRC. Public-facing LaTeX lives here.

## Mini Directory
- theory/ — canonical math formalization (LaTeX)
- architecture/ — software architecture overview (LaTeX)

## Sequence of Events
1. Read theory first, then architecture
1. Keep docs synchronized with kernel semantics

## Interlinking Notes
- Theory must match gating/kernel behavior
- Architecture must match orchestrator+ledger sequence
